## Feed My Mood

Our web app, Feed My Mood, helps people better match their twitter feed to their current desires.

Often times a person's mood can vary substantially during the hours they spend on their social media applications over the week, leading to them following a wide range of tweeters from: comedy, politics, current news, hobbies, or over-the-top personalities.

Feed My Mood solves this with a quick login, and simple controls allowing users to change their feed on the fly.

Specifically we are zeroing around five simple emotions: anger, disgust, joy, sadness, and fear.

We attempted to divide the work up based on who is strong in what area.
Ivan worked on the integration of both the twitter api and the bluemix tone analyzer.

Suman utilized handlebars and built up mySQL.

Caio and ricardo primarily pushed css and general front end work

We ran into a few complications, and we were down a member for the majority of the given project time. Navigating the documentation of new APIs can be a bit challenging at first, but they integrated well together.

In the future, we want Feed My Mood to be more intuitive in its controls, have a dynamic color scheme, and possibly more advanced mood options.
